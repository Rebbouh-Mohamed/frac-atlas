                FRACATLAS BONE FRACTURE SEGMENTATION
           REPRODUCIBILITY ANALYSIS & CRITICAL EVALUATION
========================================================================================
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
========================================================================================

This report presents a comprehensive reproducibility study of the FracAtlas bone
fracture segmentation paper. We evaluated four models:

  1. Original Paper's Published Model - Claimed high performance
  2. Our Reproduction Attempt - Following their methodology
  3. Our Enhanced v7 Model - With data corrections + augmentation
  4. Our Enhanced v8 Model - With optimized hyperparameters

KEY FINDINGS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• CRITICAL REPRODUCIBILITY FAILURE: We achieved only 60-65% of the paper's
  reported performance across all metrics (mAP50: 0.872 vs our best
  0.534, representing a 38.7% gap)

• ANNOTATION ERRORS DISCOVERED: Found missing polygon points in the public
  FracAtlas dataset's YOLO annotations, which we corrected

• SYSTEMATIC OPTIMIZATION: Tested multiple configurations (image sizes 640 vs
  800, training durations 100 vs 120 epochs) with documented results

• SUSPICIOUS ASPECTS: The magnitude of the performance gap (35-40%) suggests
  unreported methodology details, possible data leakage, or other issues

========================================================================================


SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION
========================================================================================

1.1 Background
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The FracAtlas dataset is a public benchmark for bone fracture detection and
segmentation in musculoskeletal radiographs. The original paper:

  Title: "FracAtlas: a Dataset for Fracture Classification, Localization and
          Segmentation of Musculoskeletal Radiographs"

presented a YOLOv8-based segmentation model achieving high performance metrics.
However, critical implementation details were not fully disclosed, motivating
this independent reproduction study.

1.2 Motivation for Replication
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific research, especially in medical
AI where models may be deployed in clinical settings. We attempted to:

  • Validate the published results through independent implementation
  • Identify any unreported methodological details
  • Improve upon baseline through systematic optimization
  • Verify dataset quality and annotations

1.3 Research Questions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  RQ1: Can we reproduce the paper's published performance?
  RQ2: What factors explain any performance discrepancies?
  RQ3: How do different hyperparameters affect model performance?
  RQ4: Are there quality issues in the public dataset?

========================================================================================


SECTION 2: METHODOLOGY
========================================================================================

2.1 Dataset Configuration
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dataset: FracAtlas
  • Source: Public repository
  • Images: Musculoskeletal X-ray radiographs
  • Task: Single-class segmentation (fracture detection)
  • Annotations: COCO JSON + PASCAL VOC formats provided
  • Splits: Train / Validation / Test (as per original paper)

2.2 Model Architectures
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Model 1 - Original Paper's Published Model:
  • Architecture: YOLOv8 segmentation (exact version unclear)
  • Weights: yolov8_segmentation_fractureAtlas.pt (provided by authors)
  • Training details: NOT fully disclosed in paper
  • Evaluation: conf=0.2, iou=0.7

Model 2 - Our Reproduction Attempt:
  • Architecture: YOLOv8/YOLO11 segmentation
  • Data: Original FracAtlas annotations (uncorrected)
  • Goal: Replicate their methodology as closely as possible
  • Limitations: Some hyperparameters not disclosed

Model 3 - Our Enhanced v7:
  • Architecture: YOLO11m-seg
  • Image Size: 800x800 pixels
  • Epochs: 100
  • Batch Size: 16
  • Data: CORRECTED annotations + augmentation (~5x)
  • Augmentation: Flips, rotations, HSV adjustments, RandAugment
  • Learning Rate: 0.001 (initial), 0.01 (final)
  • Optimizer: Auto (AdamW)

Model 4 - Our Enhanced v8:
  • Architecture: YOLO11m-seg
  • Image Size: 640x640 pixels (optimized for speed)
  • Epochs: 120 (extended training)
  • Batch Size: 16
  • Data: CORRECTED annotations + augmentation (~5x)
  • Augmentation: Same as v7
  • Other parameters: Same as v7

2.3 Evaluation Protocol
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All models evaluated using:
  • Confidence Threshold: 0.2
  • IoU Threshold: 0.7
  • Dataset Split: Validation set
  • Metrics: Precision, Recall, mAP50, mAP50-95, F1-Score, Dice Coefficient

========================================================================================


SECTION 3: DATA QUALITY ISSUES DISCOVERED
========================================================================================

3.1 YOLO Annotation Format Errors
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

During data preparation, we discovered critical errors in the publicly available
YOLO-format annotations for the FracAtlas dataset:

ISSUE: Missing Polygon Points
  • YOLO segmentation format requires normalized polygon coordinates
  • Many annotation files had incomplete polygon point sequences
  • Some polygons were missing intermediate vertices
  • This caused training failures and degraded model performance

IMPACT:
  • Models cannot learn accurate fracture boundaries with incomplete masks
  • Training loss may not converge properly
  • Validation metrics are artificially suppressed

3.2 Our Correction Process
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We implemented a systematic correction pipeline:

  1. CONVERSION FROM COCO JSON:
     • Loaded original COCO JSON annotations (COCO_fracture_masks.json)
     • Extracted polygon segmentation coordinates
     • Properly normalized coordinates to [0, 1] range

  2. VALIDATION:
     • Verified all annotation files for completeness
     • Checked polygon closure (first point == last point)
     • Validated coordinate ranges

  3. QUALITY ASSURANCE:
     • Visual inspection of corrected annotations
     • Comparison with original PASCAL VOC XML files
     • Automated validation scripts

3.3 Implications for Published Results
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CRITICAL QUESTION: Did the original paper's model use corrected annotations?

  • The public dataset contains erroneous YOLO annotations
  • The paper does not mention annotation correction
  • Their model achieves much higher performance than ours

POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS:
  a) They had access to corrected annotations not publicly released
  b) They used COCO JSON format directly (not YOLO)
  c) They had a different version of the dataset
  d) There are other undisclosed preprocessing steps

This represents a MAJOR reproducibility issue.

5.3 Analysis of Changes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMAGE SIZE REDUCTION (800 → 640):
  ✓ Pros:
    • 33% faster inference (23.09ms → 15.49ms)
    • Lower memory requirements
    • Enables larger batch sizes
  ✗ Cons:
    • Slight performance decrease (~1-5%)
    • May miss fine details in some cases

  ⚠️  Observations:
    • Did NOT significantly improve performance
    • Model may have reached performance plateau
    • Possible overfitting on training set
    • Suggests fundamental limitations in data or architecture

OVERALL CONCLUSION:
  • v7 achieves slightly better segmentation quality
  • v8 provides better speed/performance tradeoff
  • Neither configuration reaches paper's performance level
  • Hyperparameter tuning alone cannot close the reproducibility gap

========================================================================================


SECTION 6: CRITICAL DISCUSSION
========================================================================================

6.1 Why Couldn't We Reproduce the Published Results?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 35-40% performance gap is extraordinarily large and raises serious concerns.
We systematically explore possible explanations:

EXPLANATION 1: Annotation Quality
  • We discovered errors in public YOLO annotations
  • We corrected these errors for our v7/v8 models
  • Paper does not mention annotation correction
  • Likelihood: HIGH - authors may have used different annotation source

EXPLANATION 2: Unreported Preprocessing
  • Medical images often require specialized preprocessing
  • Histogram equalization, CLAHE, noise reduction, etc.
  • Paper provides minimal preprocessing details
  • Likelihood: MEDIUM - standard practice in medical imaging

EXPLANATION 3: Different Dataset Split
  • Train/val/test split ratios not clearly specified
  • Possible data leakage if splits overlap
  • Random seed not disclosed
  • Likelihood: MEDIUM - could account for 10-15% difference

EXPLANATION 4: Hyperparameter Optimization
  • Many hyperparameters not disclosed (learning rate schedule, warmup, etc.)
  • May have used extensive hyperparameter search
  • Likelihood: LOW - typically adds 5-10% improvement, not 35-40%

EXPLANATION 5: Model Architecture Differences
  • Exact YOLOv8 version/configuration unclear
  • May have used custom modifications
  • Model size (small/medium/large) not specified
  • Likelihood: MEDIUM - could contribute 10-20% difference

EXPLANATION 6: Cherry-Picked Results
  • Results may represent best of multiple training runs
  • Variance across runs not reported
  • No error bars or confidence intervals provided
  • Likelihood: UNKNOWN - impossible to verify without raw data

EXPLANATION 7: Data Contamination
  • Validation/test data may have leaked into training set
  • Accidental or intentional data duplication
  • Likelihood: LOW but CONCERNING if true

6.2 Suspicious Aspects of the Original Paper
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Several aspects of the original publication raise red flags:

RED FLAG 1: Incomplete Methodology Section
  • Training hyperparameters not fully disclosed
  • Data augmentation strategy vague
  • No training curves or convergence plots shown
  • Code not publicly available

RED FLAG 2: No Ablation Studies
  • No comparison of different model sizes
  • No analysis of augmentation impact
  • No hyperparameter sensitivity analysis
  • Makes replication extremely difficult

RED FLAG 3: Unrealistic Performance
  • mAP50 of 0.872 is exceptionally high for medical segmentation
  • Precision of 0.946 suggests near-perfect detection
  • No discussion of failure cases or limitations
  • Outperforms similar medical imaging tasks by wide margin

RED FLAG 4: Limited Error Analysis
  • No confusion matrix analysis
  • No discussion of false positives/negatives
  • No qualitative evaluation of segmentation quality
  • Clinical applicability not addressed

6.3 Implications for Medical AI Research
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This reproducibility failure has broader implications:

CONCERN 1: Benchmark Reliability
  • FracAtlas presented as standard benchmark
  • If results cannot be reproduced, benchmark validity questionable
  • Other researchers may be misled

CONCERN 2: Clinical Deployment
  • Medical AI systems require rigorous validation
  • Inflated performance metrics could lead to overconfidence
  • Patient safety at risk if models underperform in practice

CONCERN 3: Research Community Standards
  • Need for stronger reproducibility requirements
  • Code and model release should be mandatory
  • Independent validation studies essential
